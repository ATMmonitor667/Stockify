# Stockify Backend

This is the backend service for the Stockify application, built with Flask.

## Setup

1. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Upgrade the database:

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
flask run
