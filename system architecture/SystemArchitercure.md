The sequence diagram I created to outline the step-by-step flow of user interactions with the web platform during a trade. It starts when a user visits the explore page, triggering data retrieval from Supabase to the web layer. The user can view stock charts and open a trade window, where they input the trade amount. This input is passed through the web app and trade window layers, eventually reaching Supabase to execute the trade and update records. Once the trade is confirmed, the trade window closes, and the updated balance is displayed to the user.

The entity diagram shows the database schema used in the backend, hosted on Supabase. It is broken down into tables: profiles, posts, userstock, wishlist, and stock. Each table holds information to support user actions like making trades, viewing portfolios, and interacting with the app. The profiles table stores user-specific info like their wallet amount, and is linked to the auth.users table. The userstock table tracks what stocks users have bought and how much theyâ€™ve spent, allowing us to generate a portfolio view or calculate balances.

The component diagram maps out how different parts of the system work together. The web client built with Next.js that will be deployed on Vercel, sends HTTPS requests to Supabase, which handles database interactions via SQL and communicates with both Supabase Storage and external APIs. Supabase is at the core of the architecture, acting as the middle layer between the frontend and data storage. This visualizes how the user actions on the frontend lead to data being retrieved, stored, or modified on the backend.
