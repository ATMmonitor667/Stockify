## Running Tests Locally

### Frontend Tests
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Run tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run tests
pytest -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. tests/
```

## Example Tests

### Frontend Component Test
```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Navbar from '../components/Navbar';

describe('Navbar', () => {
  it('renders without crashing', () => {
    render(<Navbar />);
    // Add your assertions here
  });
});
```

### Backend API Test
```python
def test_hello_world(client):
    response = client.get('/')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json['message'] == "Hello, world!"
```

## Continuous Integration

Tests run automatically on:
- Every push to main branch
- Every pull request
- Every push to test-engineering branch
- Every push to Jeff_U_Tests branch

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Runs frontend and backend tests separately
- Reports test results
- Shows test coverage
- Fails if tests fail
- Generates and uploads test coverage reports as artifacts
- Test coverage reports can be downloaded from the GitHub Actions workflow page

### Viewing Coverage Reports
1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. Select the most recent workflow run
4. Scroll down to "Artifacts" section
5. Download the frontend and backend coverage reports

## Coverage Requirements
- Frontend: 80% minimum
- Backend: 85% minimum
